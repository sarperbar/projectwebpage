    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="about" class="about">
        <h2>About Project</h2>
        <p>The purpose of CSEK Requirements Management System is to develop a new, local requirements management system. One of the most important tools in this field, IBM DOORS, has served as an inspiration for the localization of our project. IBM DOORS is a requirements management tool with a significant role in the defense industry and high licensing costs. The primary goal of our project is to localize this critical tool, particularly for the defense industry, and provide a more accessible, customizable, and cost-effective alternative suitable for our country.
        </p>
        <p>
                The aim of this project is to develop a local requirements management system solution for the defense sector. Widely used technologies like IBM DOORS present operational and budgetary challenges due to high licensing costs and limited accessibility in regional defense projects. Our project aims to provide a more cost-effective, flexible, and locally developed alternative to these existing technologies.
            The system will offer configurable role-based access control based on user needs. It will allow users with roles such as Administrator, System Engineer, and Reviewer to access only the areas relevant to their specific responsibilities. This approach will ensure a secure system while minimizing potential errors. Additionally, the system will enable precise organization, categorization, and efficient management of requirements across multiple projects.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            
            The system will provide bidirectional traceability of requirements, allowing users to quickly assess how one requirement impacts others. In the context of change management, the system will ensure traceability of all changes, including revisions and deletions. Users will also benefit from reporting features that allow the export of requirements in various formats, such as MS Word and PDF.
            The completed system will not only offer a cost-effective solution for defense projects but will also add significant value in terms of data security and customization. As a locally developed software solution, it will comply with national security standards and meet the technological requirements of defense projects. Our project can be positioned as a critical step in ensuring the sustainability and cost-efficiency of the defense sector.
            Although artificial intelligence integration was considered for the generation of system requirements in the initial planning stages, it would be a better approach to leave this part as a part of the system that can be developed later due to the difficulties of finding datasets for model training. 
            In addition to this, the system is open to future development in terms of features that are not included in our current project design, such as user input of tests of system requirements, tasking feature where project managers can assign which tasks to be performed by whom, and adding different formats to the reporting process in the export section.
